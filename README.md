# Pre-Workshop Materials: U-M KGML Workshop 2025

Welcome to the pre-workshop repository for the **U-M Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML) Workshop**, sponsored by **Schmidt Sciences**.

This repository contains pre-workshop materials to help you get up to speed before the event begins. There are many different flavors of KGML, but we here focus on **physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)**. We encourage all participants to review these resources:

## ğŸ“Š Slides (`slides.pdf`)

A high-level overview of PINN concepts and motivation. Start here to understand the big picture and foundational ideas before diving into the code.

## ğŸ”¢ Notebooks (`notebook/`)

Explore hands-on PINN tutorials:
- **Notebook 1:** Harmonic oscillator (a simple example)
- **Notebook 2:** Cyclic voltammetry (a forward problem)
- **Notebook 3:** Fluid dynamics (an inverse problem)

> ğŸ’¡ Each notebook is self-contained and designed to run in Google Colab or Jupyter.

## ğŸ“¦ Data (`data/`)

Data and pre-trained models used in the notebooks. They are used in the relevant notebooks, so you do not need to read them.
